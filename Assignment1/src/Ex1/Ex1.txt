To run the benchmark, run main in the Ex1 class. It takes the number of increment threads, the number of  decrement
threads and the number of iterations as paramters. It outputs the system specs and the test results for the passed
arguments.

The test run with 100000 iterations gave strange results. It seems that with 8 threads, using the reentrant lock
is faster than using no synchronization at all. Also with one thread, using a Lock is faster than using no
synchronization at all. I suspect this is some fluke on my system, so I re-ran the test with 100 times more iterations
and got reasonable results that match my expectations.

I am not sure what fluke this might be. Maybe the JIT takes some time for the first iteration? Maybe Garbage collection
is the issue? Maybe threads get a higher priority after a while of heavy load?
