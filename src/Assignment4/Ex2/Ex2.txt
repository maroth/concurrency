As we get more and more threads, the optimistic lock gets better in comparison to the hand-over-hand locking.

This is because with more threads, it is more and more of a problem that the threads can't overtake each other.

Interestingly, the course locked set is still much more efficient in this particular scenario. This is because
it needs far fewer locks in the first place, and traversing the list ist very quick.
