Concurrency - Foundations and Algorithms
Assignment 5 Exercise 3

I implemented the queues and the barrier and ran the test 1000 times on the Sunfire machine. The averaged results are:

                2 THREADS   4 THREADS    8 THREADS
lock based:        20.443       26.29       27.599
lock free:         26.03        14.408      12.866


We can see that the lock based queue is faster with only two threads, but gets slower when more threads are added.
The lock free queue starts slower than the lock based queue, but gets faster as more threads are added.
